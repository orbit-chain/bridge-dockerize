## Overview

Orbit Bridge is a service that allows people to transfer tokens from a chain to other various chains and this project allows anyone to act as a bridge in the token transfer process.

Parser : Gathers block info and filters Orbit Bridge's transactions out of it from various chains.

Syncer : Saves the filtered info and provides data for the Operator to send transactions to various chains.

Operator : Executes transactions to various chains.

Validator : Checks if the transfer requests sent from various chains are valid.
